# Class XI and XII projects.
These are the projects which I did  in class 11th and 12th.

### Number system Conversion Project
 - You can input a number in any number system(binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal) and you can choose to convert it to any other number system. 
 - This project was developed in Turbo C++ environment in 2018 by @sadityakumar9211 as a class project and uploaded on GitHub on 19 September 2022. 
 - This project uses many legacy and abandoned functions and which are only possible to execute properly in the Turbo C++ environment. 
 - I had tried to use many functions like delay() function from <dos.h> and function to change the background color of console to make the environment much more interactive. 


### Bank Management System Project
 - This project uses the concept of file handling in C++ to store the details of customer and administrator. 
 - **Customer** can create a new account, deposit funds, withdraw funds, balance enquiry, close an account, modify the account details. 
 - **Administrator** view the details of any account profile information and account balance. The administrator can modify or delete the account if he/she want.
